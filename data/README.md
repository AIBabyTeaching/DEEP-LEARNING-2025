# Data Directory

Course notebooks primarily rely on [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets) for reproducible data access. When you run a notebook the first time, TFDS will download datasets to your configured cache directory (default: `~/tensorflow_datasets`).

If a notebook requires custom assets, place small files under this folder and commit them only when they are lightweight and redistributable. Larger datasets should be hosted externallyâ€”reference the download URL in the notebook and update `.gitignore` if you introduce additional subdirectories (for example, `data/raw/`).

For Google Colab usage, prefer mounting Google Drive or using TFDS to avoid local storage limits.
